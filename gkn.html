    <p>He's Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer, won Olympic Gold with Brazil (2016), and achieved major club success, including the Champions League with Barcelona and numerous domestic titles, known for his artistry and flair, often compared to legends like Pelé and Messi, despite facing criticism. He rose from Santos FC to become a world icon at Barcelona (forming the famed MSN trio with Messi & Suarez) and PSG, known for flair, fancy skills like the rainbow flick, and being the world's most expensive player. Though facing injury issues, he's a Brazilian legend, holding their all-time top scorer record (surpassing Pelé), embodying football's magic and chaos, and recently returning to Santos to close his career's circle.Neymar was named in both the FIFA FIFPro World11 and the UEFA Team of the Year twice. He has received the FIFA Puskás Award, the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A Best Player, the La Liga Best American Player, the Ligue 1 Player of the Year, and the Copa Libertadores Best Player. Internationally, he received the South American Footballer of the Year twice and was runner-up for the IFFHS's CONMEBOL The Best Man Player of the Decade (2011–2020) award. Neymar’s zero Ballon d’Or wins is often attributed to the fact that his career coincided with the peak of the Messi and Ronaldo dominance, finishing third behind them in 2015 and 2017, as well as his recurring injuries in the following years.
